In my mini project, I wanted to create a visual effect that goes with the sound effect. It Depending on where you click on the page, the frequencies change giving it different tone to the sound. The sound does not go away and builds up as you click more on to the page. For visuals, I went for something that mimics that of a vibrating string on an instrument. It tracks your cursor and draws lines as it follows. The colors I have chosen are dark to reflect the soundâ€™s disturbance. The pitch was set to how it is now because it gives balance between highs and lows.
